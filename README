This is a simple and personal ActionScript 3 Framework that helps me on development of interactive websites.
It's good to remember that this framework is still in beta, and you may find bugs and other problems. And most things may change drastically if for some reason I decide to recreate it. Again.

I will update the wiki pages as soon as possible with more informations about the framework and how to use it. It's very simple and it's not based on MVC or anything like that.

I'm using the excellent [LoaderMax](http://www.greensock.com/loadermax/) by greensock.
Feel free to download it and change whatever you want.
